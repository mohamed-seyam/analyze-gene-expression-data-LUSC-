## About The Project
This main purpose of this project is to implement the concepts of statistics namely **Correlation** and **Hypothesis Testing**

## Toolbox

* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scipy

## Project Walk Through
First we have two sets of data **lusc-rsem-fpkm-tcga_paired.txt** and **lusc-rsem-fpkm-tcga-t_paired.txt**, healthy and cancerous respictively.
they represent the Genes Expressions for both healthy and cancer type Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC), knowing that the data is paired.

The Project Files are in this manner

1. helpers.py: This file contains all the functions created to calculate both Correlation and Hypothesis Testing.
1. main.ipynb: This file contains the processing of the data and the outputs after each operation.
1. main.py: it is the same as main.ipynb but it does not give a visual aid of the output after each process.
